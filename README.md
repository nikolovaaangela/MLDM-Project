# Heart Attack Risk Prediction

This project applies various machine learning models to predict the risk of heart attack based on clinical patient data. It was developed as part of the Machine Learning and Data Mining course by Angela Nikolova.

## Overview

Using a dataset of 303 patient records with 13 medical features, the goal is to build a predictive model that classifies whether a patient is likely to experience a heart attack.

The project includes:

- Data preprocessing and scaling
- Model training and evaluation
- Feature importance analysis
- Decision tree visualization
- Model deployment via a Gradio web interface

## Models Implemented

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Gradient Boosting Classifier
- Artificial Neural Network (Keras/TensorFlow)

Each model is evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- Confusion matrix
- ROC curve
